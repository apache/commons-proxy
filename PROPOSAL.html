    <title>Proposal for Proxy Package</title>

    <h1>Proposal for <em>Proxy</em> Package</h1>
</div>

<h3>(0) Rationale</h3>

<p>
    Many projects require the use of proxies in order to support such features as method interception/decoration, lazy
    loading, dependency injection, etc. There are many different techniques for creating proxy objects which delegate to
    other objects (JDK proxies, CGLIB, and Javassist to name a few). Using these technologies can prove to be quite
    daunting. This package seeks to abstract away the difficult code required to implement proxies effectively and
    efficiently so that developers can concentrate on implementing the core implementations and method interceptors.
</p>

<h3>(1) Scope of the Package</h3>

<p>
    The package shall create and maintain a suite of utility classes for creating proxy objects written in the Java
    language to be distributed under the ASF license. The package will include many different "object provider"
    implementations.  The package will also serve as a repository for many useful interceptor implementations. The
    package will provide multiple "proxy factory" implementations, supporting different proxying technologies (JDK
    proxies, CGLIB, and Javassist initially).
</p>

<h3>(1.5) Interaction With Other Packages</h3>

<p>
    <em>Proxy</em> utilizes the JUnit unit testing framework for developing and executing unit tests, but this is of
    interest only to developers of the component. The original will include support for the Hessian and Burlap remoting
    protocols.  The original codebase will also include support for CGLIB and Javassist-base proxies.
</p>

<p>No external configuration files are utilized.</p>

<h3>(2) Initial Source of the Package</h3>

<p>
    The initial codebase will be contributed by James Carman based on code in the Syringe (http://syringe.dev.java.net)
    project and can be distributed under the Apache license.
</p>

<p>The proposed package name for the new component is
    <code>org.apache.commons.proxy</code>.</p>


<h3>(3) Required Jakarta-Commons Resources</h3>

<ul>
    <li>SVN Repository - New directory <code>proxy</code> in the
        <code>jakarta-commons</code> SVN repository. All initial committers
        are already committers on <code>jakarta-commons</code>, so no
        additional user setups are required.</li>
    <li>Mailing List - Discussions will take place on the general
        <em>jakarta-commons@jakarta.apache.org</em> mailing list. To help
        list subscribers identify messages of interest, it is suggested that
        the message subject of messages about this component be prefixed with
        [proxy].</li>
    <li>Bugzilla - New component "Proxy" under the "Commons" product
        category, with appropriate version identifiers as needed.</li>
    <li>Jyve FAQ - New category "commons-proxy" (when available). </li>
</ul>
